# Our Approach

We leverage the "JAM" (Javascript/APIs/Markup) stack to create scalable, cost-effective web presences. This means:

- Serverless backends deliver workloads to users on an as-needed basis, meaning you don't pay for unused server resources.
- Static file hosting means your content is available via an expansive edge network, meaning users are delivered content from the nearest geographic endpoint.

We primarily use [Vercel® Next™️](https://vercel.com/solutions/nextjs) to build our experiences and [Sanity CMS](https://www.sanity.io/) for content management.
